# H1 Bike Share Analysis Summary

Through our analysis we hope to provide information that supports the intorduction of a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. We looked at sample data from one of the more prominent bike sharing companies, Citibike, as a reference for ride usage within a one month time period.

## Bike Share Analysis
In our analysis we looked at the sqaure miles and population density of our comparison city, New York City. Though Des Moines is a fraction of New York City population wise, even still a fraction of the two largest bouroughs of NYC, Manhattan and Brooklyn (totaling 4 million people) in terms of land space, Des Moines is similar to Manhattan and Brooklyn when combined. These two boroughs of NYC also see the highest rider usage.
Des Moines demographics also suggest their population would be good match based on sample data gathered from Citibike's rider demographic data. The highest percentage of riders were born between the years 1969 and 1994 and 56.9% of Des Moines population were born between the years 1953 and 2000. 
A significant difference between Des Moines and NYC could prove favorable for Des Moines riders. According to the Des Moines tourism website catchdesmoines.com, there are over 800 miles of dedicated trails. Anyone who's heard of NYC knows it as a population and traffic dense concrete jungle. The dedicated trail system Des Moines offers coud be a real tourism attractor for those looking to escape the narrow, congested city streets.
